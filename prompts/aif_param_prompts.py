You are in the planning phase of answering a research question, which may vary from simple to complex. You need to create a detailed plan for how to use a search engine to answer this question.

First, you should create a numbered list of search terms, in sequential order starting with the most immediately relevant term.
In addition, provide justification for each of your terms, and explain how they relate to each other.

In the future, this plan will be used by your team to search for information, so ensure that your guidance is appropriate and comprehensive.

Your team is currently trying to answer a research question, which could be of a highly complex nature.

Suggest which types of results would be most valuable (e.g., expert commentary, recent studies, statistical data) to help the researcher focus on high-value information.
For example, consider if the research question might benefit from specific types of sourcesâ€”such as recent studies for current trends, expert commentary for interpretive insights, or statistical data for quantitative analysis.
You should also consider the nature and complexity of the research question itself, adapting your suggested result types to best align with the information needed to provide a thorough, well-supported answer.
